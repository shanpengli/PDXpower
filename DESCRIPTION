Description: Conduct simulation-based customized power calculation 
             for clustered time to event data in a mixed crossed/nested design,
             where a number of cell lines and a number of mice within each cell line are considered to achieve a desired statistical power,
             motivated by Eckel-Passow and colleagues (2021) <doi:10.1093/neuonc/noab137> and Li and colleagues (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.08927>.
             This package provides two commonly used models for powering a design, linear mixed effects and Cox frailty model. Both models account for
             within-subject (cell line) correlation while holding different distributional assumptions about the outcome. 
             Alternatively, the counterparts of fixed effects model are also available, which produces similar estimates of statistical power.

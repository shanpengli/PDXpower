Description: This is a R package to conduct simulation-based power calculation 
             for clustered time to event data in a mixed crossed/nested design, 
             where a number of cell lines and a number of mice within each cell line are considered to achieve a desired statistical power.
             This package provides two commonly used models for powering a design, linear mixed effects and Cox frailty model. Both models account for
             within-subject (cell line) correlation while holding different distributional assumptions about the outcome.
